# Changelog

All notable changes to **metagraphed-ui** (the metagraph.sh website) are
documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

The site is continuously deployed from `main` via Cloudflare Workers Builds;
versioning and this changelog are managed by `release-please` from
[Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) touching
`apps/ui/**`, independent of the backend's release cadence.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Public `/status` page — an overall system verdict (operational / degraded /
  partial outage) plus a recent cross-subnet incident ledger, from
  `/api/v1/health` + `/api/v1/incidents`.
- Issue templates (bug report / feature request) with a contact link routing
  data corrections to the backend repo; `CHANGELOG.md`; `FUNDING.yml`.
